        <h3>aesthetics</h3>
        
        <h4>aesthetics is used to make the character look visually
            pleasing, this will help keeps users playing the game
            and overall help the quality of the game.</h4>
        <h4>I will address this by making sure my character looks as intended and how I 
            originally designed</h4>
        
            <h3>useability</h3>
       
        <h4>useability is used to make sure how easy the character
            able to be imported into the game and how easy the character
            is to be used overall</h4>
        <h4>I will adress this by checking the files and making sure its compressed into a small]
            file to help when the game developers download my character</h4>
       
            <h3>functionality</h3>
       
        <h4>functionality is used for how many bugs/glitches are in the character
            model such as if the animations work properly or if the model looks the same
            throughout the game.
        </h4>
        <h4>I will adress this by rendering the 3d often making sure the shaders
            and animations work and will try to fix any problems I find by either
            searching up an awnser or trying to use my current knowledge to fix it</h4>
        <h3>Intellectual property</h3>
        <h4>this is very important to my character not just for copywriting my own character 
            but also making sure my character won't accidentally infringe on another persons 
            characters copy right</h4>
        <h4>I will adress this by making my character from scratch to make sure my character has
            little probability of looking like someone elses and after I finish making my character
            I will ask other 3D artists if the character looks similar to theirs and see if they will 
            press charges if my character does break thier copy right if so I will change the color and
            some patterns or the type of clothing they wear</h4>

    <h3>head feedback</h3>
    <h2>"it looks like an egg", "the head is a little too thick" I was 
        able to tackle this feedback and was able to make the head thinner
        to make it look less like a head</h2>
    <h3>leg feedback</h3>
    <h2>"your legs are absolutely splendedid however, you need to make the legs
        more clear on where the ligaments" to fix this issue I made the knees thinner
        from the side view and made the knee more prominant.</h2>
    <h3>torso feedback</h3>
    <h2>"your torso looks good but just add more detail in the front" to fix this I added
        more muscle detail so I can properly see how the torse is formed and the build of the
        body</h2>
    <h3>arms foodback</h3>
    <h2>"for your arms are uneven and the side views his arms look like a basaeball bat"
        to fix this I reshaped the arms to make them more symetrical and adjusted the side view to make
        the elbow more prominant to stop it from looking like a baseball bat</h2>
